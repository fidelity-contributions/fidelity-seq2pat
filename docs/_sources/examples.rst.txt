Usage Examples
==============

Examples on how to use the available constraints can be found in the `Usage Example Notebook`_.

Supported by Seq2Pat, we proposed **Dichotomic Pattern Mining** (`X. Wang and S. Kadioglu, 2022`_) to analyze the correlations between
mined patterns and different outcomes of sequences. DPM plays an integrator role between Sequential
Pattern Mining and the downstream modeling tasks, by generating embeddings of sequences based on the mined frequent patterns.
An example on how to run DPM and generate pattern embeddings can be found in `Dichotomic Pattern Mining Notebook`_.
